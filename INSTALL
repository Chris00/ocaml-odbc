	OCamlODBC : Accessing databases from OCaml via ODBC

*** What is OCamlODBC ***

OCamlODBC is a library allowing to acces databases via an Open
DataBase Connectivity (ODBC) driver from OCaml programs.

*** What you need ***

- OCaml >= 3.0x installed (3.01 or 3.02 for the Biniki example)
- ODBC driver installed (headers and libs), for example iODBC for
  MySQL or the PostgreSQL-ODBC package for PostgreSQL
- LablGtk >= 2.6 installed for the Biniki example
- make ;-)

*** How to compile ***

- ./configure <options>
	(./configure --help to see options, or myconf for an example)
- make <db>
	where <db> can be one or several of the following :
	- mysql
	- postgres
	- db2
	- openingres
	- unixodbc
	- oraclecfo
	depending on which ODBC drivers are available on your system.

You may need to make some changes to compile successfully:
  - in master.Makefile the -ldopt should be replaced by -Xlinker

You may have a look at the Makefile.nt, configure.nt and Exemples/Makefile.nt files
to compile under Windows with MinGW, thanks to David Allsopp which gave these
files with this comment:
>> I have produced a Makefile.nt with accompanying configure.nt scripts which
>> attempt to replicate the behaviour of Makefile. To build and install the
>> entire system under Windows, from a Cygwin bash prompt, execute
>>     make -f Makefile.nt findlib_install
>> or
>>     make -f Makefile.nt direct_install
>> depending on which installation method you wish to use. This builds the
>> bytecode library ocamlodbc.cma and native code library ocamlodbc.cmxa linked
>> with the Windows ODBC Interface.
>> Exemples/Makefile.nt compiles the four example programs using the library.


- make install
	will install the compiled libraries in
	<ocamldir>/lib/ocaml/ocamlodbc/[mysql|postgres|db2|openingres|unixodbc|oraclecfo]

*** How to use ****

The directory 'Exemples' contains some examples.
- cd Exemples
- make BASE=XX PROG to create monitor.x
	where XX can be MYSQL, POSTGRES, DB2, OPENINGRES or unixODBC, ORACLECFO
- monitor.x <a database> <a user name> [<a password>]' to connect to a
  database ; you can type in commands on the prompt (select * from ...)

The directory Biniki contains a simple application to execute SQL
queries and display the results in a window. It needs LablGTK 1.2.
- cd Biniki
- make fr or make en to create a link to the messages file you want
- make <db> to create biniki and biniki.opt
	where <db> can be mysql, postgres, db2, openingres or unixodbc
- biniki[.opt] <base> [user [password]]
  to connect to a database you're allowed to, and enjoy !

OCamlODBC with another database system, so i can add it to the
distrib.
